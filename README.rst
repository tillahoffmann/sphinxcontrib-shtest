shtest tests shell commands in your Sphinx documentation. The :code:`shtest` directive supports the usual `doctest <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html>`_ syntax. It offers the following options:

- :code:`:returncode: [integer]` specifies the expected return code (defaults to 0).
- adding the :code:`:stderr:` flag compares results with the :code:`stderr` rather than :code:`stdout` stream.
- :code:`:cwd: [relative path]` specifies the working directory relative to the source of the document (defaults to the directory containing the source document).
- :code:`:tempdir:` executes the test in a temporary directory.

Installation
------------

1. Run :code:`pip install sphinxcontrib-shtest` to install the package.
2. Add :code:`"sphinxcontrib.shtest"` to your :code:`extensions` list in :code:`conf.py` to enable the extension (see `here <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-extensions>`__ for details).
3. Execute :code:`sphinx-build -b shtest /path/to/source/directory /path/to/output/directory`. The :code:`-b shtest` flag executes the shell tests; run without the :code:`-b shtest` flag to build your documentation as usual.

Examples
--------

.. shtest::

    # Obligatory hello world example.
    $ echo hello world
    hello world

.. shtest::
    :stderr:

    # Read from stderr instead of stdout.
    $ echo message on stderr >&2
    message on stderr

.. shtest::
    :returncode: 1

    # Use a non-zero expected return code.
    $ false

.. shtest::

    # Run multiple tests in one directive.
    $ echo hello
    hello
    $ echo world
    world

.. shtest::
    :cwd: tests

    # Run a test in a particular working directory relative to the document.
    $ cat hello.txt
    world

.. shtest::
    :tempdir:

    # Run a test in a temporary directory.
    $ echo hello > world.txt

.. sh:: ls -l
